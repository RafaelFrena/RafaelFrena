### Hi, I'm Rafael Frena ✌️

- 👨‍💻 I'm a computer programming student at the Federal Institute of Santa Catarina (IFSC);
- 🌱 I'm currently focusing on learning more about Web Development while working on academic projects at IFSC;
- 💭 I'm willing to become a front-end web developer and I'm interested in developing games, being in the development process of the game D'outro Lado (which will hopefully have its first release later this year);
- ✨ Cool fact about me: Apart from coding, I like music and language learning, but I actually end up travelling through several fields of science in order to fulfill my craving for knowledge.
